Originally this website was developed with the help of a UDEMY course: The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp

Although this was about 2 years ago, this course kickstarted my development career.

# goals

My mission is develop a fun personal website where I am able to freely express the things I am interested in learning as well as the things I have learned.

As well as to refresh my mind on the basics of web development.
