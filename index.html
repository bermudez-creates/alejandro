        <h2 class="middle-title">"Freedom is all I want"</h2>
        <p>
          As dorky as it may sound of one of my role models has been a fictional
          character named Luffy. Luffy has inspired me to not be afraid of
          chasing my dreams because he is completely without fear nor doubt of
          what his dreams are, his most famous quote is him shouting out exactly
          what his dream is. That type of fearlessness is what I admire most.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality my idea of freedom is the ability to get up every day and
          be allowed to choose how I spend my time today. My dream is to gather
          up skills in areas I am genuinely interested in, like art or
          technology and recently I've been wanting to put an engine together. I
          want to gather up these skills so that no matter where I am my value
          as a person will alwasy be high, meaning a job is secured.

          <h3>AS AN ARTIST</h3>
          <p>
            Since I was in Elementary I admired graffiti art. In fact the first
            dream I dreamed was to paint murals in countries like Brazil or
            Colombia. As I've grown this dream has changed a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now my dream is to build a reputable brand around my art name
            @Steezy. I see myself in my own studio, taking commission paintings,
            booking appointments for tattoos, and most recently I've had the
            urge to make a clothing brand (I have never attempted this).

            alt="Skill2"
          />
          <h3>POWER_USER</h3>
          <p>
            The term "power user" feels like a fitting title since my interest
            in technology is a little broad. I'm no expert in either field but I
            have always been interested in being able to make things work or
            even work in ways they were not meant to.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a software developer I have been working on personal projects
            such as an
            <a class="future-link" href="https://clone-ccbf2.web.app/"
              >Amazon</a
            >

            clone so that I can try and keep up with skills which are relevant
            in todays market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides having done projects with software mainly, I have also
            taking apart and fixed or cleaned hardware like replacing a
            motherboard for a tv with a burned out capacitor, or cleaning a PS4
            and replacing the heat sink for better performance.
