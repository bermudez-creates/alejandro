        <h2 class="middle-title">"Freedom is all I want"</h2>
        <p>
          As dorky as it may sound of one of my role models has been a fictional
          character named Luffy. Luffy has inspired me to not be afraid of
          chasing my dreams because he is completely without fear nor doubt of
          what his dreams are, his most famous quote is him shouting out exactly
          what his dream is. That type of fearlessness is what I admire most.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality my idea of freedom is the ability to get up every day and
          be allowed to choose how I spend my time today. My dream is to gather
          up skills in areas I am genuinely interested in, like art or
          technology and recently I've been wanting to put an engine together. I
          want to gather up these skills so that no matter where I am my value
          as a person will alwasy be high, meaning a job is secured.

          <h3>AS AN ARTIST</h3>
          <p>
            Since Elementary I have been influenced by art, my first dream waas
            to be a taxi driver, the second was to travel the world painting
            murals. Now my dream is to build a reputable brand around my art
            name @Steezy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I see myself in my own studio, taking commission paintings, booking
            appointments for tattoos, and most recently I've had the urge to
            make a clothing brand (I have never attempted this).

          />
          <h3>POWER_USER</h3>
          <p>
            The term "power user" feels like a fitting title since my interest
            in technology is a little broad. I'm no expert in either field but I
            have always been interested in being able to make things work or
            even work in ways they were not meant to.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a software developer I have been working on personal projects
            such as an
            <a class="future-link" href="https://clone-ccbf2.web.app/"
              >Amazon</a
            >

            clone to better understand the development process for myself so
            that I may fully intergrate myself in the professional market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hardware has also been an interesting to look into, I have been able
            to fix TV's and clean PS4's. It is interesting how small components
            that look like miniature city's work together to bring objects to
            live.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hacking has also been interesting to me and I use to wonder
            (doubtfully) if I would be able to work in Cybersecurity. Recently I
            have been gaining more confidence and have started diving more into
            cyberesecurity by exploring topics like Game hacking and
            Portswiggers Academy. I'll admit that I can't confidently list this
            as a skill on a resume but I have enough interest in this topic to
            explore it and hopefully get certified in the near future.
